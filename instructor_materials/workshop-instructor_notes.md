## Curveballs

Some ideas from IDM222 to throw into the work shop:

### Team Members (optional)

At some point in the first 15 minutes, request a representative from each group assemble all team members names on a sheet of paper and provide to the billing department (aka the instructor).

Once students have almost finished filling out the paper, announce the information should be emailed rather than in paper form.

### Adjust the wireframe (optional)

At the 30 minute mark of Milestone 3, change something about the wireframe that would cause a shift in the layout.

### Take a break

At the 45 minute mark of Milestone 3 (half way point), stop the time for two minutes and encourage students to take a break, stretch, use the restroom etc.

### Adjust the style tile (optional)

Immediately after the break, change something about the style tile. Possibilities include:

- require a different font
- require a different color scheme
- require a specific image/logo be used

### Adjust the content

At the 60 minute mark of Milestone 3, the client provides a new wine list that is 100 items long instead of 20.

Provide this link via the BB Wiki and inform the teams that all 100 items must be present in their prototype to be considered.

### Encourage Assembly and Testing

At the 75 minute mark of Milestone 3, encourage teams to pinpoint someone to take the lead on assembly and begin getting their parts together for deployment. Encourage 5 minutes of testing and tweaking. Also encourage submission requirements are met with time to spare.
