^ Break yourselves up into groups. (preferably three groups. _NOTE_ if there are only two groups, the point values have to be adjusted for each milestone)

## Milestones

- Wireframes
- Style Tiles
- App Prototype

^ Similar to last term, there will be milestones that must be reached before we advance through to the next phase of development. These milestones will be:

---

### Milestone 1 - Wireframes

- time limit: 10-15 minutes
- submission: link on BB wiki OR whiteboard drawing
- looking for: RWD wireframes - small through large

^ All teams will be given 15 minutes to develop wireframes for the intended design. To submit your wireframes, either post a link to your files on the wiki, or draw your wireframes on the whiteboard. Everyone will need access to your wireframes. We're looking for a design concept ranging from small to large screens (roughly a smartphone to a desktop).

^ After the 15 minute deadline, we'll review all wireframes. The winning team's wireframes will then be used by all teams moving forward. The winning team will be awarded three extra credit points.

---

### Milestone 2 - Style Tiles

- time limit: 10-15 minutes
- submission: link on BB wiki
- looking for: typography, color scheme, patterns

^ All teams will be given 15 minutes to develop style tiles for the intended design. To submit your style tile concept, you must post a link on the wiki. Everyone will need access to your wireframes. We're looking for a design concept for the site's typography, color scheme and image patterns. Don't forget, typography means more than just selecting a font face. Show us paragraphs, headings, links, call to action text, buttons etc.

^ After the 15 minute deadline, we'll review all style tiles. The winning team's style tile will then be used by all teams moving forward. The winning team will be awarded three extra credit points.

---

### Milestone 3 - App Prototype

- time limit: 90 minutes
- submission: link on BB wiki
- looking for: a functioning prototype

^ All teams will be given a maximum of 90 minutes to build a working prototype of the application. The final submission must be a link on the BB wiki that links to a working web interface (hosted by someone in the group). We will review the prototypes and the winning team will be awarded five extra credit points.
