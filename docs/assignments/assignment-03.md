## Assignment 03 - Delete Recipe + Search Page

This assignment is strictly functionality. No CSS is required for this assignment.

### Requirements

- Add the ability to delete a recipe. No screen is required but the functionality should work.
- Create a screen (Search Page) that will list your search results on a page for the client facing part of yours site. If there are no results, please display some type of message letting the user know.
- Upload your up to date code to github
- Push your code to production (Bluehost)

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit the following items in [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/) under **Assignment 02** Submission:

1. A link to your GitHub repository (i.e. "idm232-abc123") containing the code for your project.
2. Link to the two working pages (Must work). Since you can't link to a delete page, just link to a page where I can hit the delete button.

Example Submission

```
Github Repo: {link-to-your-project repo}
Search: {link-to-your-example}
Delete a recipe: {link-to-your-example}
Instructions on how to delete a recipe: {add notes on how to delete just incase it's not clear}
```

**Please double check your work and make sure all links are working before submitting. Broken links will cause you to lose points. Late submissions receive zero points.**
