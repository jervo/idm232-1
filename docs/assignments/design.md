# IDM232 Alpha

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Alpha Description

Create Designs for your final project pages.

You do not have to create every single page for the entire final project. Instead you should be focused on building at least one template for every style of page your final project will need. The designs should look similar to a production ready website you'd send to a client to review. No wireframes, no low-fidelity designs. Examples:

### Requirements

- Desktop screen designs

#### User/Client Screens

- Category listing screen
- Recipe Detail Screen
- Search Results

#### Admin Screens

- View all Recipes Screen
- Add / Edit Recipe Screen
