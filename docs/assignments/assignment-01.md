# IDM232 Alpha

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Assignment 01 - Github + Server Setup

## Github

- Setup a github repository for this class that lives out of `{path-to-project-folder}/public_html`.
- This repo should contain a `final` folder with an `index.php` inside of it.
- Inside this `index.php`, write php code that will output a string exactly with `Assignment - 01` on the page

## Server

- Create a folder on your server called `idm232`. Inside of there, you should copy your github repo into that folder (This would be everything inside your `public_html`folder)
- If you did that correct, you should be able to visit `https://{your-domain-dot-com}/idm232/final`. This should load the index.php work you did above
